bluePi

This program uses a Raspberry Pi computer as an A2DP Sink. It was originally
developed for use as an audio solution for use in the car.


--Version 1.0--
bluePi works as a headless unit with no GUI. It performs device search and
will automatically connect with trusted devices. bluePi works as a bluetooth
agent which can pair and trust new devices but provides no meaningful method
of device authentication.
